# PBS
A suboptimal solver for Multi-Agent Path Finding

Priority-Based Search (PBS) is an efficient suboptimal algorithm for solving Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF).
More details can be found in our paper at AAAI 2019 [1]. 
(This implementation is not the original code for producing the results in the paper.)

The implementation provides a SIPP option that uses SIPPS [2] (instead of state-time A*) 
in the low level of PBS to plan paths for agents.

**This branch allows agents to have zero goal locations. 
Their goal locations are represented by -1 in the scen files (see example in my.map and my.scen).
They can complete their paths at any location on the map 
except for the locations in the avoid_locations set specified in the driver.cpp file.** 

## Usage
The code requires the external library [boost](https://www.boost.org/).
If you are using Ubantu, you can install it simply by
```shell script
sudo apt install libboost-all-dev
``` 
Another easy way of installing the boost library is to install anaconda/miniconda and then
```shell script
conda install -c anaconda libboost
```
which works for a variety of [systems](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/libboost)
(including linux, osx, and win).

If neither of the above method works, you can also follow the instructions
on the [boost](https://www.boost.org/) website and install it manually.


After you installed boost and downloaded the source code, go into the directory of the source code and compile it with CMake:
```shell script
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE .
make
```

Then, you are able to run the code:
```
./pbs -m random-32-32-20.map -a random-32-32-20-random-1.scen -o test.csv --outputPaths=paths.txt -k 50 -t 60
```

- m: the map file from the MAPF benchmark
- a: the scenario file from the MAPF benchmark
- o: the output file that contains the search statistics
- outputPaths: the output file that contains the paths 
- k: the number of agents
- t: the runtime limit

You can find more details and explanations for all parameters with:
```
./pbs --help
```

To test the code on more instances,
you can download the MAPF instances from the [MAPF benchmark](https://movingai.com/benchmarks/mapf/index.html).
In particular, the format of the scen files is explained [here](https://movingai.com/benchmarks/formats.html).
For a given number of agents k, the first k rows of the scen file are used to generate the k pairs of start and target locations.
